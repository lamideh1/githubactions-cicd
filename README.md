# githubactions-cicd
Project Overview
You are building a GitHub Actions workflow that:

Builds and tests a Node.js application

Uses modular workflows

Optimizes performance using caching and parallel jobs

Applies security best practices (like secrets management)

Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Tools and Setup Needed:

Node.js project (with package.json)

GitHub repository

GitHub Secrets: (create in repo settings > Secrets)

ACCESS_TOKEN

AWS or other deployment credentials (optional)

Step 2: Create Workflow Files
Create a .yml file in .github/workflows/.

Example File Structure:
markdown
Copy
Edit
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── build.yml
    ├── deploy.yml
    └── lint-test.yml
Step 3: Build Workflow (build.yml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Build Node.js App

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
Step 4: Lint and Test Workflow (lint-test.yml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Lint and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  lint-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x, 18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - run: npm ci

      - name: Run Linter
        run: npx eslint .

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
Step 5: Deploy Workflow (Optional - deploy.yml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Deploy Application
        run: |
          echo "Deploying..."
          # Add AWS CLI or CDK deployment commands here
Step 6: Security Considerations
Use secrets to store sensitive info (Settings > Secrets)

Never hardcode credentials in YAML

Use permissions: blocks in jobs to minimize access if needed

yaml
Copy
Edit
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
Step 7: Modularization
If you reuse steps often (like setting up Node.js), create a composite action in .github/actions/setup-node/:

action.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Setup Node
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
Then use in your workflow:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node
Final Advice:
Validate YAML syntax using YAML Lint

Push and test each workflow step by step

Monitor workflow runs under GitHub → Actions tab

Would you like a downloadable template or GitHub repo structure for this?
